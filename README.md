TASK: 
Your website will contain the following pages:
1. Welcome! (index.html): this page should be a general information page
that helps the visitor understand what this site is, and navigate to the
other pages. May be short and simple. Common theme for site: Being a
first-year student (at OsloMet).

2. Reflection-essay: This page must contain a short text (500-700 words)
describing the challenges experienced by the (one, several or all)
members of the group when transitioning from upper-secondary school
(or work-life) to university. Reflect on any of the following topics:
a) learning to code, or
b) being a student rather than a pupil, or
c) managing the workload.
Please illustrate with screenshots of code or illustrating images if you
can. Else, we recommend using images of OsloMet to create a mix of
headings, paragraphs, and images for this page. We shall not assess the
language/grammar of the paragraphs. We expect headings, text and
images that relate to each other (content). Headings should be
informative and grammatically correct (proper visual hierarchy).

3. Accessibility page: It must contain a short presentation of accessibility
(up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for
accessibility using an automated test. Also explain how you checked,
validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an
automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the
testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of
your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we
are certain to read. (Grammar not important.)

4. Topical information page: Technology and society (with external links)
Write – or re-use a short text you have previously written – (anywhere
from 300 to 1000 words) about technology and society. You are allowed
to reuse text from "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers"
or other subjects. This text should have multiple links to external sites
with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the
information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to
be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to.

5. Fun page: Make one page that is in a different layout and have a
different styling than the others. Put in some text and images. We accept
place-holder text, but don’t use copyrighted images. Or you can present
an activity or a place in Oslo. This page is an opportunity to be creative and shine. You may embed video or sound, but again: beware of
copyright, please! Don’t forget to consider the size of the media files
(videos or pictures). 


How we shall grade: 

• Structure and navigation, wide screen and small screens: Are the pages
well structured (with headings, paragraphs, images) and is it easy to
navigate between the pages? We shall check this on different screens.

• Accessibility and legibility: We shall look both at the automated test and
use our experience to assess how well designed the pages are. (The
«Fun page!» Is not part of "Accessibility"-assessment.) Your description
will assist us in understanding the choices you have made.

• Ease of maintenance: Is the code easy to maintain for a new developer?
Can someone else take over your work and modify, change, and further
develop this site using their IDE of choice (rather than the one you
used)? We shall look at the code itself. Is it well-structured and easy to read? Are you following conventions for comments? Is the CSS well
organised with each element styled only once (if possible)? Is the
structural code (like boxes) separate from code that define the visuals?
Et cetera.

• The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an
automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you
reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire
site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts
without a common theme?

• We accept reuse of code from you obligatory assignments.

• If you reuse code from other resources, please no more than 5 lines of
code, and be sure to cite (include a comment to reference the original
resource or website).

• Remember not to include any personal information in the text, as these
are public sites and GitHub servers are located outside the GDPR/ EU
jurisdiction.
